## Introduction
When we do research, we always need to read a lot of papers, these papers need two features:
* it is related to our research topic.

* it is published on famous conferences.

However, there is no such a search engine fulfilling both of two features. Google Scholar only fulfills the first feature. ACM Digital Library or dblp only fulfills the second feature. And arxiv is not even a search engine. So I want to build a web-based tool which can search the paper only in conference I am interested in.

## How To Use

You can click this [web-based tool link](http://121.4.16.168:8000/search), then type in the wanted keyword to search the paper. 
The top 100 related paper in recent 3 years will be listed by relavance. 
If you want to custom the year and conference, just add them in keywords.
Now it supports {wsdm, sigir, kdd, recsys, iclr, icml, nips}.
